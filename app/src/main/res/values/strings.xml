        Awala enables compatible apps on your device to send and receive data from the Internet
        securely, even when you’re disconnected from the Internet.

    <string name="onboarding_title_2">Using Awala is easy</string>
    <string name="onboarding_text_2">
        When you’re connected to the Internet, your apps will simply use it seamlessly.
        \n\nWhen you’re cut off from the Internet, Awala couriers will transport your apps’ data
        securely to and from the Internet.

    <string name="onboarding_title_3">Awala keeps you safe</string>
    <string name="onboarding_text_3">
        Awala apps use end-to-end encryption, so it’s impossible for this app or couriers to see
        their data.
        \n\nIt’s also impossible for couriers to find out which apps you’re using. And needless to
        say we aren’t tracking you or your apps!
