# Relaynet Gateway for Android

This repository contains the source code for the Relaynet Gateway for Android, which is all Relaynet users need on their Android devices. To learn more about using Relaynet, visit [relaynet.network](https://relaynet.network/users).

This document is aimed at advanced users and (prospective) contributors. We aim to make the app as 
simple and intuitive as possible, and we're therefore not planning on publishing end-user 
documentation at this point.
